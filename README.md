# 🏖️ The Seacoast Hotel
The Seacoast Hotel is a static website I designed to
promote a fictional beach hotel and their services.
This project was a fun way to solely test and refine
my HTML and CSS skills by building a modern, visually
appealing website–even if the hotel itself doesn’t exist.

The Seacoast Hotel website includes:

+ The hotel’s history which provides depth to the site and a rich backstory.
+ An interactive reservation form that allows users to reserve a room.
+ A contact page for visitors to get in touch.
